          <h2>branding + website designs</h2>
          <p>My boyfriend James McClay and I created this website using Wordpress. A family friend was in need of a website for their realtor ventures, so we created a simple yet sophisticated website. The goal of the website is to make the house hunting process quicker. Instead of a realtor showing their clients all 8 floorplans in person, they can focus on the floorplans that caught their eye on the site. <br><br>
            
          The Central Florida New Home Inventory website is not fully completed yet, but only needs a few more additions to meet our clients goals. I created the logo for the business, which was chosen from a variety that I created. Using the created color scheme, we were able to use Wordpress Customizer tools, as well as additional CSS to make this website aesthetically pleasing and useful.
