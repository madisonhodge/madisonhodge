            <h2>magazine mockups</h2>
            <p><br>A couple of years ago I created a blog named Halcyon Girls. It was a way for me to express myself, and it helped me find my true passions: art, writing, and digital design. Since then, the blog has transformed into This is Halcyon, although it is currently on hold because of my college classes.     
            <br><br><br>
            The online zines were published on Issuu, and were created with the help of submissions from girls around the world. The photography and writing in the mockups is not my own, but the design and layouts are. In the future, I plan to return to creating for my blog and make more zines.
